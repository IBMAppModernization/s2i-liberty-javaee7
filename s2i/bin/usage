This is an S2I WebSphere Liberty base image that is responsible for consuming a JEE project and deploying it onto a WebSphere Liberty application server.
To use it, install S2I from: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation:

s2i build https://github.com/WASdev/sample.ferret.git websphere-liberty libertys2itest

You can then run the resulting image via
docker run -p libertys2itest

Details:
If a pom.xml file is present in the source directory then the project is built with maven and the output in target will be copied into the Liberty deployments directory /config/dropins/.
If a pom.xml file is not present then the source code will be coppied instead. The WebSphere Liberty start script located in /opt/ibm/wlp/bin/ is called when the container is run which in turn checks to see if an application is present in the /dropins folder then runs it.
